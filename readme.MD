# Advent of Code

From https://adventofcode.com/:

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
>
> You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## Why participate?

For me personally it is a fun way of learning a new language. In 2021 I used [F#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)) to attempt to solve all puzzles.
